# Song_Energy_Levels

## Progress
So far I have a CNN model which is applied on the mel spectrograms of 360 songs from the Jyvaskyla dataset. The model performs poorly (53%) accuracy at the moment and requires improvement.

## Things tried so far
* I have tried using 1D CNN and 2D CNN on the mel-spectrogram (1D CNN by reducing one of the dimensions of the spectrogram) with no significant result.
* Trying out only dense layer based models
* Trying out only binary classification to classify happy songs against sad songs.
* Trying out MFCC based model


## Outlook
* Using Temporal CNN
* Trying other different other kind of spectrograms to see if they give significant results
* Trying out datasets other that the Jyvaskyla dataset
* Trying out LSTMs
* Trying out Emotion AI models
